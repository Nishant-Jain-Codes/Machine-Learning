    "## Practice Questions\n",
    "1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : True and False\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three Boolean operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : and , or , not \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : \n",
    "```python\n",
    "True and True = True\n",
    "True and False = False\n",
    "False and True = False\n",
    "False and False = False\n",
    "\n",
    "True or True = True\n",
    "True or False = True\n",
    "False or True = True\n",
    "False or False = False\n",
    "\n",
    "not True = False\n",
    "not False = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?\n",
    "   - (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False\n",
    "   - not (5 > 4) -> False   \n",
    "   - (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True\n",
    "   - not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  -> False\n",
    "   - (True and True) and (True == False) -> False\n",
    "   - (not False) or (not True) -> True\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : == , != , < , > , <= , >=\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : == checks for equality , = assigns a value to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value. You can use conditions to control what code is executed and what code isnâ€™t executed, depending on whether the condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Identify the three blocks in this code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spam = 0\n",
    "if spam == 10:\n",
    "    print('eggs')\n",
    "    if spam > 5:\n",
    "        print('bacon')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('ham')\n",
    "    print('spam')\n",
    "print('spam')\n",
    "```\n",
    "answer : \n",
    "```python\n",
    "#b1\n",
    "if spam == 10:\n",
    "    print('eggs')\n",
    "    if spam > 5:\n",
    "        print('bacon')\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print('ham')\n",
    "    print('spam')\n",
    "#b2\n",
    "if spam > 5:\n",
    "    print('bacon')\n",
    "#b3\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('ham')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code that prints \"Hello\" if 1 is stored in spam, prints \"Howdy\" if 2 is stored in spam, and prints \"Greetings!\" if anything else is stored in spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spam = input()\n",
    "if spam == 1:\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "elif spam == 2:\n",
    "    print(\"Howdy\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Greetings!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : Ctrl + C\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  What is the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : The break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop. The continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  What is the difference between `range(10)`, `range(0, 10)`, and `range(0, 10, 1)` in a for loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer: They all do the same thing. The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including) 10, range(0, 10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0, and range(0, 10, 1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1,11):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while i < 11:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  If you had a function named `bacon()` inside a module named `spam`, how would you call it after importing `spam`?\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra credit: Look up the `round()` and `abs()` functions on the internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer : round() returns the rounded value of a number , abs() returns the absolute value of a number"
